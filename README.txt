// TODO

(1) Clean up code
(2) Add functionality to sum consumption on single side of the origin (0, 0)
    (2.1) Add functionality to only plot that single side of fire spread (apply to both graphs)

// Tentative
(1) Design "next best position" and "next best height" functions
(2) Rewrite animate() function, to be dynamic in plot size relative to input
(3)
